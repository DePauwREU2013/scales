scales
======

Scales is a Scala library aimed at providing an accessible and easy to use DSL for creating and manipulating graphics, sounds, animations, and user interactivity. The library is intended to be used to introduce novice programmers to functional programming language concepts.

The present iteration of Scales (3.0) is the result of a summer **R**esearch **E**xperience for **U**ndergraduates (REU) hosted at DePauw University.

The REU program was led by Dr. Brian Howard, a professor of Computer Science at DePauw. The undergraduate researchers who contributed to the project were:

+ Vivian Chen (Vassar College)
+ Mervin Fansler (Millersville University of Pennsylvania)
+ Ben Harsha (DePauw University)
+ Rudra Vishweshwar (DePauw University)

The previous iteration (2.0) was a 2008 REU project of Kate Lopez and Dan Mateas.
